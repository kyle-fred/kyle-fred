# 👋 Hi, I’m Kyle Finch

I’m a **Java backend engineer** based in London, specialising in the design and delivery of robust, scalable, and production-ready systems. My work spans backend services, cloud-native infrastructure, and automation — most recently leveraging **Spring Boot**, **PostgreSQL**, and **AWS** to solve real-world engineering challenges at scale.

I’m currently deepening my expertise in backend architecture and system design, with the goal of contributing to high-impact, distributed platforms that demand performance, resilience, and clean design at scale.

## 🎯 My Focus

- **Core Specialty**: Java (Spring Boot), REST APIs, database modelling, CI/CD
- **Current Learning**: System design, event-driven architectures, microservice communication
- **Complementary Skills**: AWS (5x Certified), Docker (DCA Certified), GitHub Actions, Flask, React
